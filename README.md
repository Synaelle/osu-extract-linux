# osu! extract for Linux
This bash script extract your osz &amp; osk files, and put them directly into osu! and extract them.

Take in note that the project is a thing that I've made for fun! Don't hesitate to point any issues!

**IT REQUIRES THE UNZIP PACKAGE!!**

*Any solution that doesn't require the unzip to extract osu! archives is totally welcome!*

## Usage
Just slide the script into a folder, and launch it.

On the first time, it will ask your osu! folder location, put the absolute path! (If you didn't put that correctly, you can reset your config by deleting the cfg file or just launch the script with the argument reset)

Relaunch it and it will do the work!

## To-do
- Find a way to open the osk & osz (and osr) directly with the game 
- Auto-detect osu! folder maybe?
- Create an optional loop so it's possible to keep the script running in background
