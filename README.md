# osu! extract for Linux
This bash script extract your osz &amp; osk files, and put them directly into osu! and extract them.

## Usage
Just slide the script into a folder, and launch it.

On the first time, it will ask your osu! folder location, put the absolute path! (If you didn't put that correctly, you can reset your config by deleting the cfg file or just launch the script with the argument reset)
